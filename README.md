# Multidimensional-Features-Based-High-Precision-Model-for-Typical-Social-Network-User-Classification
In recent years, social network users have been the focus of research, but existing research often divides users into normal and abnormal users, lacking a more detailed analysis. To address the absence of precise user classification model, this paper builds a three-dimensional classifies model including Anti-bot Analysis, Malicious Publicity and Hashtag Manipulation for measuring user behaviors and classifying users into four categories: harmless users, publicizing users, hashtag hijacking users and malicious publicizing users. Based on the classification model, this paper has built a set of user classification features combined with feature engineering, and introduces four new features. We also create two new Weibo user datasets and one Twitter user dataset by crawling and manual labeling, and re-processes an existing Weibo user dataset. The experimental results show that the model and features pro-posed in this paper have good classification efficiency for precise Weibo us-er classification and bot behavior recognition, and have obvious classification improvement for decision trees and BP neural networks.
